			<h1 class="mt-3">Our Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h4>GENERAL</h4>

			<p>Practice Marketing, Inc. (“Company” or “we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of its users (“user”
				or “you”) that use our website located at https://brander.video/, including other media forms, media
				channels, mobile website or mobile application related or connected thereto (collectively, the
				“Website”). The following Company privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you, as a user
				of the Website, about the types of information that Company may gather about or collect from you in
				connection with your use of the Website. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which
				Company uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information. Changes to
				this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time you use the Website, however,
				the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time you use the Website you
				should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the beginning of this document) and
				review any changes since the last time you used the Website.</p>

			<p>The Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S. state and federal law. If
				you are accessing our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised that you are transferring your
				personal information to us in the United States, and by using our Website, you consent to that transfer
				and use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You also agree to abide by
				the applicable laws of applicable states and U.S. federal law concerning your use of the Website and
				your agreements with us. Any persons accessing our Website from any jurisdiction with laws or
				regulations governing the use of the Internet, including personal data collection, use and disclosure,
				different from those of the jurisdictions mentioned above may only use the Website in a manner lawful in
				their jurisdiction. If your use of the Website would be unlawful in your jurisdiction, please do not use
				the Website.</p>

			<p>BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

			<h5>GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h5>

			<h5>Users of the Website Generally</h5>

			<p>“Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information,
				cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast,
				is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a
				specific person. Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the Website
				Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may
				make available. That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system,
				browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating
				and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not Personally-Identifying
				Information, it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service
				provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical
				usage data. Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website
				to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in
				usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of
				content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying
				Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in
				the usage of the Website.</p>

			<h5>Web Cookies</h5>

			<p>A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a website stores
				on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a
				query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services you have used, to record
				registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your user preferences, to
				keep you logged into the Website and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to
				track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’
				experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other
				Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes and
				discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners
				and others better understand how the Website is being used. COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB
				COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE
				WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT
				THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
				LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>



			<h5>Third-Party Advertisers</h5>



			<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website. These companies may
				use information (not including any Personally-Identifying Information) about your visits to the Website
				and other websites that are contained in Web Cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and
				services of interest to you. Using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative, you can opt out
				of several third-party ad servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously. If you would like more
				information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these
				companies, please follow the following links: http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp,
				http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Please contact us if you would
				like to know the identity of the third-party advertising companies we are currently using to serve ads.
			</p>



			<p>We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements, and we
				may use any of the Non-Personally Identifying Information we have collected (including information you
				may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal
				information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. We do not
				identify you to the advertiser.</p>



			<h5>Web Beacons</h5>



			<p>A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the user
				and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email.
				Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count users who have visited particular
				pages, viewed emails and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’
				Personally-Identifying Information. They are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated
				statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web
				Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the
				Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by
				declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is
				tendered, permitting you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis. </p>



			<h5>Analytics</h5>



			<p>We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google
				Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize
				and serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including Google Analytics for Display
				Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data,
				determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. If you do not want
				any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web
				browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display
				Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google’s Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads).
			</p>



			<h5>Aggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information</h5>



			<p>We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any of the above
				circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and
				deliver targeted advertising on the Website and on websites of third parties. We may combine
				Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information
				collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including
				advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For
				example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features
				or services accessed. This information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may
				be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest
				and to target content and advertising.</p>



			<h5>Mobile Device Additional Terms</h5>



			<p>Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device to access the Website or download any of our applications, we
				may collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and manufacturer), operating
				system, version information and IP address.</p>


			<p>Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or track any
				location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile
				application or our services, except that it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address
				the geographic location of your point of connectivity, in which case we may gather and use such general
				location data.</p>

			<p>Push Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive them, letting you know when
				someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters. If you wish to opt-out from
				receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device’s settings.</p>


			<p>Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of
				our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information, such as how often you use the
				application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data and where
				the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics
				software to any Personally-Identifying Information you submit within the mobile application.</p>


			<h4>SOCIAL MEDIA </h4>



			<p>We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Website to your account on some social
				networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on
				the Website. When logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the
				Personally-Identifying Information you have made publicly available on the social networking site, such
				as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend
				list and any other information you have made public. Once connected, other users may also be able to see
				information about your social network, such as the size of your network and your friends, including
				common friends. By connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social networking site,
				you hereby consent to the continuous release of information about you to us. We will not send any of
				your account information to the connected social networking site without first disclosing that to you.
				Each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls around your information on their
				system, and our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature
				is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and
				therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.</p>



			<p>We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect you to a social network if you click on the
				respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button,
				Twitter’s “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin will be activated and
				your browser will directly connect to that provider’s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of
				your data will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider. So for example, when you
				click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website, Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser
				version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the
				Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and
				are not within our control.</p>



			<h4>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h4>



			<h5>Website Registration</h5>



			<p>As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with
				a specific person. Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about
				Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by Company about users is
				information provided by users themselves when (1) registering for our service, (2) logging in with
				social network credentials, (3) participating in polls, contests, surveys or other features of our
				service, or responding to offers or advertisements, (4) communicating with us, (5) creating a public
				profile or (6) signing up to receive newsletters. That information may include each user’s name,
				address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial
				information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other
				financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your
				gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic or relevant information as
				determined by Company from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company
				with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may
				prevent the user from using certain Website features.</p>



			<p class="font-weight-bold">BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE
				OF YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF
				PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION” SECTION.</p>



			<h5>Online Postings</h5>



			<p>Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a matter of course as
				a result of your use of the Website. We may provide areas on the Website where you can post reviews and
				other information relating to your activities on the Website. Such postings are governed by our Terms of
				Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the
				subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on
				publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used
				by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot
				control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so
				we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. USERS
				ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY
				DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p>



			<h5>Company Communications</h5>



			<p>We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services
				offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related
				announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. Generally, you may opt out
				of such emails at the time of registration or through your account settings, though we reserve the right
				to send you notices about your account, such as service announcements and administrative messages, even
				if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>



			<h5>Company Disclosures</h5>



			<h4>Company will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances:</h4>



			<p>By Law or to Protect Rights. When we believe disclosure is appropriate, we may disclose
				Personally-Identifying Information in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent or take other
				action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the
				rights, property or safety of Company, our users, our employees or others; to comply with applicable law
				or cooperate with law enforcement; to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in
				response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order or a request for cooperation from
				a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend
				against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal
				objection or right available to us.</p>


			<p>Marketing Communications.Unless users opt-out from receiving Company marketing materials upon
				registration, Company may email users about products and services that Company believes may be of
				interest to them. If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from Company, you may do so by
				following the unsubscribe link in the email communications, by going to your account settings (if
				applicable) or contacting us using the contact information below.</p>


			<p>Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your Personally-Identifying Information, which may include
				your name and contact information (including email address) with our authorized service providers that
				perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer
				service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting the Website’s
				functionality and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through the
				Website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our
				authorized service providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may have access
				to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such
				information for any other purpose.</p>


			<p>Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. Company reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying
				Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition,
				bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company’s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a
				bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information
				will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new
				privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying
				Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy
				adopted by the successor organization.</p>


			<h5>Changing Personally-Identifying Information; Account Termination</h5>



			<p>You may at any time review or change your Personally-Identifying Information by going to your account
				settings (if applicable) or contacting us using the contact information below. Upon your request, we
				will deactivate or delete your account and contact information from our active databases. Such
				information will be deactivated or deleted as soon as practicable based on your account activity and
				accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. To make this request, either go to your
				account settings (if applicable) or contact us as provided below. We will retain in our files some
				Personally-Identifying Information to prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist with any
				investigations, to enforce our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted by
				law. Therefore, you should not expect that all your Personally-Identifying Information will be
				completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. Additionally, we keep a history of
				changed information to investigate suspected fraud with your account.</p>



			<h5>General Use</h5>



			<p>Company uses the Personally-Identifying Information in the file we maintain about you, and other
				information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Website (1) to deliver the products
				and services that you have requested; (2) to manage your account and provide you with customer support;
				(3) to communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or
				services that may be of interest to you either from us, our affiliate companies or other third parties;
				(4) to develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Website and other
				sites; (5) to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems; (6) to measure consumer interest in our
				services; (7) to inform you of updates; (8) to customize your experience; (9) to detect and protect us
				against error, fraud and other criminal activity; (10) to enforce our Terms of Use; and (11) to do as
				otherwise described to you at the time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to
				identify problems. In particular, we may examine your Personally-Identifying Information to identify
				users using multiple user IDs or aliases. We may compare and review your Personally-Identifying
				Information for accuracy and to detect errors and omissions. We may use financial information or payment
				method to process payment for any purchases made on the Website, enroll you in the discount, rebate, and
				other programs in which you elect to participate, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent
				transactions and otherwise as needed to manage our business.</p>



			<h4>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY</h4>



			<p>Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing
				Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy
				Policy. However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect
				to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third parties, or that those
				third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include advertisers, providers of games,
				utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications accessible through the Website.
				Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and applications accessible through the
				Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third
				parties that operate them. Before visiting a third party, or using a third-party application, whether by
				means of a link on the Website, directly through the Website or otherwise, and before providing any
				Personally-Identifying Information to any such third party, users should inform themselves of the
				privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website or application,
				and should take those steps necessary to, in those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.</p>



			<h4>SECURITY</h4>



			<p>We take the security of your Personally-Identifying Information seriously and use reasonable electronic,
				personnel and physical measures to protect it from loss, theft, alteration or misuse. However, please be
				advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate all risks. We cannot guarantee that
				only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention
				of any privacy settings or security measures.</p>



			<p>We are dedicated to protect all information on the Website as is necessary. However, you are responsible
				for maintaining the confidentiality of your Personally-Identifying Information by keeping your password
				confidential. You should change your password immediately if you believe someone has gained unauthorized
				access to it or your account. If you lose control of your account, you should notify us immediately.</p>





			<h4>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h4>



			<p>Company may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes to
				Company’s Privacy Policy will be reflected on this page and the date new versions are posted will be
				stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to
				all information that we have about you and your account. Users should regularly check this page for any
				changes to this Privacy Policy. Company will always post new versions of the Privacy Policy on the
				Website. However, Company may, as determined in its discretion, decide to notify users of changes made
				to this Privacy Policy via email or otherwise. Accordingly, it is important that users always maintain
				and update their contact information.</p>



			<h4>CHILDREN</h4>


			<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) protects the online privacy of children under 13
				years of age. We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personally-Identifying Information from anyone
				under the age of 13, unless or except as permitted by law. Any person who provides
				Personally-Identifying Information through the Website represents to us that he or she is 13 years of
				age or older. If we learn that Personally-Identifying Information has been collected from a user under
				13 years of age on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps to cause this
				information to be deleted. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a
				member of the Website or has otherwise transferred Personally-Identifying Information to the Website,
				please contact Company using our contact information below to have that child’s account terminated and
				information deleted.</p>



			<h4>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4>



			<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are
				California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
				the Personally-Identifying Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing
				purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the
				categories of the Personally-Identifying Information that was shared and the names and addresses of all
				third parties with which we shared Personally-Identifying Information in the immediately preceding
				calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit
				your request in writing to our privacy officer as listed below. </p>



			<h4>DO-NOT-TRACK POLICY</h4>
			<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
				can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
				monitored and collected. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT
				signal, the Website currently does not respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms.</p>

			<h4>What is Data Processing?</h4>
			<p>Our platform's main function is to share the recordings to social media. But to do that we add some more
				information to the video. Like adding the <b>"End Screen Image"</b>, <b>"Title"</b> and
				<b>"Captions"</b> to the video. This is what we call Data Processing in our terms. We're not using any
				user's social account data in processing. Our user's have an option to put the <b>"Title"</b> &amp;
				<b>"End Screen Image"</b>. We also provide an option to generate the <b>"Captions"</b> for the
				recording. So This is what we mean by Data Processing.
			</p>

			<h4>How we're processing the Data.</h4>
			<p>
				These are the steps
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User's update their <b>"End Screen Image"</b> </li>
				<li>User's add a <b>"Title"</b> &amp; generate the <b>"Captions"</b> of the recording.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>

			<h4>What is the purpose of Data Processing?</h4>
			<p>The purpose of Data Processing is that Users can share the recordings to Social Media like <b>Facebook
					Profile/Group/Page, YouTube, Linkedin Profile/Page</b> etc.</p>

			<h4>Are we saving user's Social Account data?</h4>
			<p>No, We're not saving any of the user's details. That's the reason&nbsp;users have to authenticate us each
				time they want to post any video from our server to their social media accounts.</p>

			<h4>How can a user revoke their Facebook access token?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>First of all, we don't save access tokens, unless they allow us to keep posting the video after a
					certain time period, customized by the users.</li>
				<li>Secondly, users can revoke the access tokens from their Facebook account setting</li>
				<li>
					Please follow the below steps to revoke the tokens
					<ol>
						<li>Open you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&amp;ref=settings"
								target="_blank">Facebook Setting</a>, You must be logged in to Facebook.</li>
						<li>
							<p>Scroll down and find the <strong>Videosocials</strong> app in the list, that will look
								like the below screenshot.</p>
							<img src="/Videosocials_files/vs-fb-access.png">
						</li>
						<li>User's can click on the <strong>Remove</strong> button to revoke access.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>
